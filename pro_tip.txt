Pro Tip for fellow classmates! Just in case you get lost
For step 6, The basic cycle goes like this;
1) nano/vim/etc blahblah_blahblah.txt
2) make changes and save! (For nano, this is Ctrl S and Ctrl X!)
3) git add blahblah_blahblah.txt
4) git commit -m "[your message here]"
5) and if you wish to push, which I have foolishly done, you can type 
git push -u origin [either Master for main repo, or the name of your branch]

I'm lowkey enjoying this github thing.
