Spotify and being on computers is fun. I love just going on vmware,
setting up a linux system i'm never gonna use, make a cool background for it
set up neofetch and essentially make it look real pretty.
It serves no practical use. I installed debian expecting to rely on it but
I quickly came to realize how minimal Debian is... Kali is sorta my 
favourite linux distro, it's not as chaotic as Arch, it's not too basic,
and - most importantly for me, It can be made pretty.

I might try out Arch, just cus it's so popular. :)
